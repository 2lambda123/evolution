# Request for Comments

This repository hosts ideas, requests and discussions about the advancement of CAF. It aims to improved the visibility and openness of the process. RFCs are reserved for changes that:

* Affect the public API
* Rework essential parts of the framework
* Introduce major new features

Small contributions, bugfixes and low-impact changes should still be posed directly via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework/issues) or as a [pull request](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework/pulls) of the main repository.

## Contributing

1. Copy the file `0000-template.md`. Leave the number at 0000 until it is ready to be merged into the repository and the number can be assigned with certainty.
2. Fill in the template. The issue and PR fields are optional.
3. Open a pull request with the proposal.
4. Discussion takes place in the PR.
5. Accepted RFCs are merged into the repository.

An accepted RFC does not lead to prioritization regarding its implementations. 

*The review and acceptance process still require specification.*
